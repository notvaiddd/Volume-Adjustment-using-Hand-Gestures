Logic:

The program captures real-time video using OpenCV and processes each frame with Mediapipe to detect hand landmarks.
It identifies the positions of the thumb tip (landmark 4) and index finger tip (landmark 8).
Volume Control:

The Euclidean distance between the thumb and index finger is calculated, and this distance is mapped to a range of system volume levels using the pycaw library.
The closer the fingers, the lower the volume; the farther they are apart, the higher the volume.
Feedback:

Visual feedback is provided by drawing circles on the detected thumb and index finger, along with a line connecting them.
The current volume level is displayed on the screen in percentage form.
Control:

The system volume is updated in real time, based on the gesture distance, using pycaw.
